# `svd_board`

This crate contains autogenerated structs and accessor methods for the memory mapped registers of various ARM boards based on CMSIS SVD files.

## Usage
The crate supports multiple boards. For each board, there is a cargo feature (see the `features` section in the Cargo.toml). You have to choose exactly one feature. For example:

```toml
[dependencies.svd_board]
version = "0.1.0"
features = ["stm32f7"]
```
